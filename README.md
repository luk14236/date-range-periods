# date-range-periods
This script generates date ranges for various periods, such as the current week, month, quarter, and year, as well as the last week, month, quarter, and year, along with custom periods like the last 3 weeks and last 6 months. It then creates a DataFrame with columns for the date and the type of period it belongs to.
